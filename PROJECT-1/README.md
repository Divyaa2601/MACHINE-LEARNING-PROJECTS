**Students Performance EDA**

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the **Students Performance Dataset**.
The goal is to analyze factors that influence students' academic performance across subjects like **Math, Reading, and Writing**, along with demographic and socio-economic factors.

**ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**

**Students_Performance_EDA.ipynb** â†’ Main Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and visualizations.

**README.md** â†’ Documentation for the project.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes student scores in:

  -Math
  
  -Reading
  
  -Writing

and additional attributes such as:

  -Gender
  
  -Race/Ethnicity
  
  -Parental Level of Education
  
  -Lunch Type
  
  -Test Preparation Course
