**Used Car Price Prediction**

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features such as car brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.
The notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**

**Used_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb** â†’ Main Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis and model.

**README.md**â†’ Documentation for the project.

**data/** â†’ Folder containing dataset.

**ðŸ“Š Dataset**

The dataset contains the following information about used cars:

  -Car brand/model
  
  -Year of manufacture
  
  -Mileage
  
  -Fuel type
  
  -Transmission
  
  -Owner type
  
  -Selling price

**ðŸš€ Getting Started**

1. Clone the Repository
   
      git clone https://github.com/Divyaa2601/MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS.git
   
      cd MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS/PROJECT-2
   
2. Install Dependencies

      Ensure you have Python (>=3.7) installed. Then install the required libraries:
      
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

3. Run the Notebook
   
      jupyter notebook Used_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb

**ðŸ“ˆ Workflow**

The notebook covers:
  
  -Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  
  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  -Feature Engineering
  
  -Model Building (Regression models)
  
  -Model Evaluation (RÂ² score, RMSE, etc.)
  
  -Price Prediction for new data

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

  -Python
  
  -Pandas
  
  -NumPy
  
  -Matplotlib
  
  -Seaborn
  
  -Scikit-learn
  
  -Jupyter Notebook

**ðŸ“Œ Key Insights**

  -Car price is highly influenced by year of manufacture and mileage.
  
  -Fuel type and transmission also play a significant role in pricing.
  
  -Regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost can be used for predictions.
